# Improved Knots & Crosses

This webpage allows users play the game knots and crosses (best of three).

It was created to put to practice what I had learned in covering the *JavaScript* **Factory** and **Module** patterns.

In the past I had tackled this same challenge ([Old Version Live](https://elliot-akande.github.io/knots-and-crosses/)), creating a similar Knots and Crosses webpage. However, after growing more in programming ability, I decided to give it another go to create a webpage that is more representative of my current skill set.

Thank you for taking the time to view my project! 
All criticism is welcome.
